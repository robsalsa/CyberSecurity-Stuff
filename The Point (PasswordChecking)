The Point of this code:

Like the name says this code is to check if the Password that a user inputs is ass or not.

it does a little do-while loop that will simply just check if you actually input something because in IRL putting in nothing should not work.
    Same goes for if passwords have spaces.

there is a bunch of initializations in boolean the reason for this is because there is a lot to check. For example the perameters is if the password has: 
    ONE UpperCase Letter
    ONE LowerCase Letter
    ONE Number
    ONE Special Letter (,./;'[]\=-)(*&^%$#@!)   all of that stuff

Finally it simply ends


Things that maybe should change:
    Maybe fixing the availability of the user fixing the password after a trash password is entered.
    Maybe also allowing the user to see if they'd like to continue with a "strong" password.
    Maybe the use of a Recursion when placed inside something bigger... or even placed in a HTML (or Front-End) program
